          <p class="info">
            Quantum computing is a form of computation that makes use of quantum mechanics phenomena to effectively increase the efficiency of computation exponentially.[4]<br><br>
            Quantum Computers are essentially a quantum counterpart to classical computers.<br><br>
            Although there may not be any extremely complex calculations that can be solved any faster in quantum computers than in classical computers, there will be one day, and when that day comes we will be ready.

        <h1>When and where was the concept first applied?</h1>
        <div>
          <p class="info">
            First proposed in the 1980s by Richard Feynman and Yuri Manin, the concept of quantum computing was first applied in 1998 by three researchers Neil Gershenfeld, Isaac Chuang, and Mark Kubinec. Each from MIT, the Los Alamos National Laboratory, and UC Berkley respectively.[1]<br><br>
            The 2 Qubit System worked by applying a magnetic field to a solution of chloroform and water at room temperature to orient the rotations of the atom nuclei. A rotation that was parallel to the magnetic field was qualified as a 1 and a rotation that was antiparallel to the magnetic field was qualified as a 0. On top of that, radio frequency pulses were applied to act as a flipping mechanism of the rotation of each nuclei, resulting in layered parallel and antiparallel states[1]

          <p class="info">
            We need quantum computers to solve the very specific problems that classical computers cannot. For example:<br><br>
            Let's say a developer in the future begins work on an artificial intelligence, but the AI is taking too long to learn because of the complex algorithms it must be run through to actually retain and process information. This problem could be fixed with a quantum computer which would be exponentially more efficient in the training process than a classical computer<br><br>
            Or perhaps a pharmaceutical company like Johnson & Johnson is working on the production of a new drug but it's in it's early phases, quantum computers would be able to model the molecules in the drug in a quantum space to see how they interact with eachother, therefore streamlining the testing process.[3]

        <h1>How does it work?</h1>
        <div>
          <p class="info">
            Classical computers work through billions of transistors which can only store data in binary form, that is either a 0 or a 1.<br><br>
            Quantum computers work with qubits which can essentially model a quantum phenomena called superposition, meaning they can be anything from 0 or 1 or both at the same time. That is, before we measure it, once it's been measured it falls to a definitive state.[3]<br><br>
            Qubits alone can't do much,  but with a ton of qubits certain quantum algorithms can be used to exploit another quantum phenomena called entanglement, which allows for each qubit to be individual yet continually linked. This means that with quantum computations we can predict what the definitive state of a qubit will be once we measure it, making the calculations a lot more efficient.[3]<br><br>
